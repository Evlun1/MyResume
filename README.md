# MyResume

This is my resume, please have a read :) 

It is based on [rendercv](https://rendercv.com/) python package, which creates [resume files](rendercv_output) from [a main yaml file](Guillaume_Pattier_FR_CV.yaml). 

If you are curious, I left a few bonus points in the yaml file.

To render, you can either : `make render` or `rendercv render "Guillaume_Pattier_FR_CV.yaml"`.
